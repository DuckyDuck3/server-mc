# The first setting to change   #
# in this file is for           #
# determining when the          #
# hunter(s) has(have) won.      #
# This setting is for multiple  #
# speed runners only.  If they  #
# win once all the speedrunners #
# have died, then the           #
# "allMustDie" value should be  #
# set to true.  If only one     #
# must die, then it should be   #
# set to false.  By default it  #
# is set to true.               #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

allMustDie: true
